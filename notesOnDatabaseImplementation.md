# NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION OF LOGICAL MODEL IN SQLITE

To initialize/create the database (once populated can no longer be stored on
github) first create an empty database then run the dbSchema.sql script
```
sqlite3 finData.db 'VACUUM;'
cat dbSchema.sql | sqlite finData.db
```

Notes on some of the idiosyncrasies of SQLite and other decisions made when
creating the SQLite database:
- Some of the elements of the logical model have been renamed to avoid naming
conflics (Values for example is a reserved word)

- SQLite doesnt have a seperate date datatype, instead SQLite functions
can choose what representation to store the datetime in. Ive opted to
store dates as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS").

- Prices will be stored as TEXT, as the SQLite REAL type is a floating point
type, and we agreed to prioritize precision

- Booleans will be stored as INTEGERs, with 0 representing false and 1
representing true, as per SQL convention

- Rows of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY are automatically set to point to
autogenerated ROWID column, serving as primary key and are autofilled when
inserting into the table

- I have added a boolean field to store weather or not data has been
interpolated by data harvester. This is as per Daniels sugjestion and has
so far been discussed with Marti and George

- I have added indecies on Asset.AssetClass, Values.AssetTicker
and Values.IsInterpolated as these are the rows most likely to be merged
