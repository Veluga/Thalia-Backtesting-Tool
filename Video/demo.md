When we first go to the website, we're presented with this decription page of Thalia.
​
Now, if you're not familiar with backtesting or Thalia, there's a small section on the subject, with the _Learn More_  button taking you to the About page.
​
In order to use Thalia, you need an account. It's very simple to create one - you just need a username and password. So let's go ahead and create one real quick.

[Type in username "ThaliaIsCool" and password "LiveLaugh1nvest?"]
There are a few limitations on passwords - that is they need to contain at least one letter, number, and special character; and they need to be at least 8 characters long.
​Having created an account, we can now go ahead and log in.

[Log in.]

Now that we're logged in, we can go to the _My Portfolio's_ tab.

[Place mouse on link.]

You can see the link in the NavBar right here.

[Click the link.]

This is where you can see and manage all your portfolios. This is a new account, so we don't have any just yet. Let's remedy that by making our first portfolio.
​
To do this, we need to go to the _Dashboard_.
​
[Go to dashboard.]

The first thing we have to do is decide what time period we're interested in. Here, you can see the default is between the 1st of January 1970 and today.
​
The next thing is our _initial investment_. The default here is 1000 dollars. I'm happy with that, so let's go down a little bit.

You can see that the thing below is contribution and rebalancing. We're going to ignore that for just a moment and focus on the more essential part - selecting assets and allocating funds to them.
​​
Let's just pick two assets here, and give 50% to each of them.

[Pick two TBD assets and type 50 next to them in the allocation table.]

Now these numbers here don't need to add up to 100, like percentages. So if I change this 50 to a 30 nothing bad will happen - I'll just have a different allocation. But personally I like percentages, so let's change it back.
​
Coming back up for a moment, if I have an income and want to use it to invest more into my portfolio as time goes on, we can model that here with _contribution_. So let's say I want to put an extra 100 dollars worth into my portfolio every month, I just type 100 here and select _monthy_ here.
​
Over time, it's possible that these assets will go up and down in value differently, so this nice 50-50 split might not stay 50-50 for long. Now, if you've decided that you don't want that, and you'll buy and sell regularly to keep the portfolio at its initial balance, you can model that by selecting a _rebalancing_ frequency.

That's all that goes into _creating_ a portfolio, so let's clear this out and show off lazy portfolios.

[Delete assets from the allocation table. Click on a lazy portfolio.]
​
You can name your portfolios if you want. Let's call this one "My First Portfolio".

[Rename portfolio.]
​
Quite often we want to compare portfolios against each other. To do this, all we have to do is click this button to add a portfolio and fill in the details.
​​
[adds another lazy portfolio] OR [Adds a normal portfolio to spend more time]

You can fiddle about with the options here as much as you want, but for now let's actually look at the results of what we've done.

[Click Submit.]
​
[Summary.]

Here, we can see a plot of our returns over time. And there's some other key information here, but if you want more detail on any of this, you can go to the corresponding tab.
​
We'll be taking a look at each of these.​

[Key metrics]

The key metrics are presented in the form of a table.
​
[Returns]

We can look at the annual returns in a graph or a table.
​
[Drawdown]

And the same for drawdowns.
​
[Assets]

Finally, we have a breakdown of the assets that make up the portfolios.
​​
Now that we have our results, we can save them in a PDF if we want.

[Export to PDF.]

After seeing the backtest results we're free to go back to the allocation tab and tweak the settings to try and improve our portfolio's performance. But if we do this repeatedly we run the risk of overfitting - where you optimise for specific market conditions that might not be applicble in general.

[Overfitting]

If you're concerned about this, go to the _Overfitting_ tab and click on _Check Overfitting_.

[Side-by-side examples of positive and negative results.]
