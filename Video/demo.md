In order to create a portfolio, the user has to set the dates that he is interested in. The default date values are 1/1/1970 and the current date.
​
Then the user inserts the Initial investment. The default value is of 1000$.
​
The next essential step is that of selecting the financial assets and the allocation percentages.

Here is an example of how to add two assets to the portfolio and then delete them.

After submitting the portfolio or portfolios if more were created the user can go the tabs that have just become available in order to check the backtesting results.​

The summary contains a plot with the total returns overtime followed by some key information extracted from the metrics, returns, drawdowns and assets.
​
If the user wants more details about each one of those he can click on the corresponding tab in order to see the full details.
​
For an in-detail look, we will look at each one of the tabs.
​

For the returns it displays a plot with the yearly differences and table with the annual returns.
​
[show drawdown]
The drawdowns are displayed as a yearly drawdown plot and drawdown table.
​
[show assets]
And in the end a breakdown of the assets that make up the portfolios is given.
​​
After checking how the portfolio or portfolios performs the user can go back to the ticker selection tab in order to tweak the settings. In addition to this he can click on the "Export to PDF" button in order to export the current backtesting results as a PDF.
​​
After multiple rounds of tweaking the risk of overfitting can appear.
​
​As a result, we have added an overfitting checking mechanism.
​
OR
​
This is a scenario where the user has tweaked a portfolio in such a way that it makes a huge profit over an extremely specific period of time. This is something that should be avoided and as a consequence, we have added an overfitting checking mechanism.
​​
If the user wants to check for overfitting he can simply go to the overfitting tab and click on Check Overfitting.  He then is informed if overfitting was detected in any of his portfolios.
​
Now that we have shown a demonstration of our product we will go into the technologies used to create it.
