## Questions to answer
* What is an asset?
* What is a portfolio?
* What is backtesting?
* How does backtesting provide value to an investor?
* Who would use this product (scenario)?

## Script
* Before we jump into a demonstration of Thalia, let us quickly define some common vocabulary and show a scenario where backtesting could provide value to an investor. 

Let's quickly go over a couple of definitions:

* An Asset is an item of property owned by a person or company. Gold, real estate, stock in a company, or the money in your wallet are all examples of assets. The trade of some asset (for another asset) between different people or companies constitutes a market. For example, people trade Microsoft stock for US$ on the corresponding market of the New York Stock Exchange.

* A Portfolio is a collection of assets that are owned at the same time. Most often, an investor creates a portfolio to meet some investing objective, such as saving to buy a house or to fund college education. An example portfolio may contain 25% Gold, 43% AAPL, 2% Bitcoin, and 30% US Treasuries. Typically, individual investors favor certain assets over others due to their characteristic risks and return, depending on their investing objective. A young person may craft a portfolio that is more risky but offers greater returns while a person nearing retirement may mix risky assets, such as stocks, with more conservative assets, such as government bonds.

* The process of constructing a portfolio brings us to backtesting. Backtesting is the exploration of the historical performance of a given portfolio and investment strategy. While past performance is never an indicator of future results, backtesting can help reveal the risk/return nature of a portfolio by showing its performance over the last 2, 10, or even 100 years. The longer the timeframe, the less prone your findings to overfitting, which is simply bias to certain market conditions.

### Scenario

Consider the case of Allison, a young finance student who wants to create a portfolio to start her own investing journey. Eager to try her hand at picking stocks, she selects ten companies that she believe will perform well. Upon running a backtest for this portfolio over the last 30 years, she discovers that she would have had to suffer through temporary losses of up to 70% during the Great Recession. Skeptical of her abilities to sit patiently through a crisis of that magnitude, she decides to shoot for lower returns with less downside. Applying her finance knowledge, she adds a government bond fund to her portfolio and runs another backtest. Happy with the results, she calls her broker and makes some orders.
[Show a picture of Allison. Show her pie chart for ten companies. Show the plot for the historical returns and an alarmed Allison. Show the new pie chart and the new plot. Show a happy Allison that calls her broker.]

### Summary
* To summarise, you now know what an asset and portfolio is and how backtesting can help you gain insight on the risk/return characteristics of an investing strategy.
