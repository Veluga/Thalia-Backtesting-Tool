# MOVING FORWARDS

### INITIAL RELEASE
The following are the steps that need to be taken to ready the first version of Thalia for release.  As with initial development, we will be pursuing an agile development strategy leading up to and following the intial release. Decisions regarding what technologies and service providers to use will therefore also be deferred in the interst of ensuring flexability.

The following is the tentative release plan for the first versions of Thalia, and is still subject to change. A buffer of several weeks will also be accounted for when declaring the official release date. This will be done to accommodate any unforseen blockers that may arise during this process.

##### HOSTING AND CROSS PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
Hosting of the application will be outsourced to a hosting service provider. This will allow us to ensure scalability and quality of service of our product, as major service providers provide guarantees for both of those things. In addition to this, support will slowly be added for additional browsers and platforms. In addition to Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, that will already be supported by the first version of Thalia, support will be added for remaining major desktop browsers. We will also work to make the website easy to use on mobile browsers.

##### DATA GATHERING
Throughout the time leading up to release, data will be gathered on additional commonly traded assets. The more assets we aquire the more appealing out platform will be to investors, therefore we will continue this process after release. Commodities and Stocks differ from other asset classes like cryptocurrencies and indecies, in that a wide range of both of these is commonly invested in.
Prices for these will be easier to gather once we have established a userbase, and have the additional capital required to approach larger entities such as exchanges for data.

##### PAYMENT SUPPORT INTEGRATION
After registering as a business and opening a business account we will begin working on support for payments. Our target is to deploy our platform with support implemented for Paypal, Visa, Union Pay and Mastercard payments as these are used for the majority of online commerce [2]. There are a number of integrated payment solutions providers on the market that could offer support for all of these and more.

##### SECURITY AUDIT
There are two reasons why a security audit is a necessery step before release. Firstly, as we are handling clients' payments through the platform, we must ensure that their payment and account information is kept safe. Secondly, as we aquire more data on historical prices, some of that data may no longer come from public sources. Therefore, we will hire an external contractor to perform a full security audit. Assuring a high overall degree of security will allow us to manage the risk inherent to providing cloud based solutions and as our codebase is relatively small, handling mostly non sensative data, we expect the allocated timeframe should suffice.

##### TESTING AND EVALUATION
Before release extensive testing will be conducted to detect any bugs in our software and assess wether or not further changes need to be made. The aim of testing will be to assess wether or not we have met the goals of each phase. Evaluation of the value of our software will also be preformed among users. After seeking approval from the University Ethics Committee, a focus group of retail investors will be assembled with the goal of trialing our product. they will be asked to evaluate the usability of the interface and the feature set we provide. The decision to make further changes or add aditional features and key figures can then be made. If deemed neccessery the servies of deciated software testers can be employed to give a final evaluation of Thalia's functionality.

### LONG TERM FUTURE AND EXPANSION STRATEGY
Following Thalia's release, the team will continue to add additional features and assets to our offering. Financial analysis is a dynamic field and metrics for portfolio evaluation popular with investors change frequently. In addition, new financial assets such as new cryptocurrencies and new company stocks also frequently enter the market. This means that ongoing development is necessary if we are to become and remain competetive in the fintech industry.

Due to the accessible price point of our tool we expect a large increase in the number of users on our platform in the months following deployment. As product adoption improves, we also expect to see more advanced users, that have been using backtesting solutions for a longer period of time to switch to switch to Thalia. As our platform becomes more established and as advertising and media coverage increase we also expect to attract newer users, who lack knowledge of existing backtesting solutions. We have identified several major features that could be implemented going forwards to better cater to these groups:

  - Support for a limited scripting language to be used within Thalia. this could allow users to automate reactions to sudden market movements, allowing them to better simulate their portfolio as part of a dynamic trading strategy.
  - Algorithms to highlight market movements and common market patterns. This would be especially appealing to investors that rely heavily on technical analysis of markets and stocks.
  - Significant events that affected the historic prices could be flagged, allowing them to form a deeper understanding of the results of their simulations.

As part of our future plan for monetization, our team will also begin assessing the feasibility of a version of our product aimed at integration with online brokerage platforms. This would be sold to platforms on a subscription basis, allowing us to further take advantage of the massive brokerage market, witch in the US alone grosses around 380 billion dollars[1]. Another potential strategy for market entry we will consider is the adding of features to Thalia similar to those found on online brokerage sites. These include, but are not limited to the tracking of live prices of assets and options to buy and sell commodities (through integration of other platforms or selling them ourselves). This would allow us to shift from providing an isolated service to creating our own self contained ecosystem of financial tools.
