# MOVING FORWARDS

### INITIAL DEPLOYMENT
The prototype version of <*Product Nejm*> already includes the key features sought after by our target market, therefore only a few small steps separate us from initial deployment. As with development we will pursue an agile strategy for deployment. This means we wil aim to be as flexible as possible, deffering decisions regarding specific technologies and solutions as long as possible. Our main focus will be to ensure flexibility and transparency througout the entire process.

The following is a roadmap of the steps to be taken before our software is ready for its official launch, and the approximate time needed for each. With the exception of the security audit and user testing, witch must be preformde once the others are completed. As we are a small team, much of this work will be outsourced to external contractors, allowing us to avoid the overhead of providing training to team members and speeding the process up considerably.

##### 1. HOSTING AND CROSS PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY (1 week)
Hosting of the application will be outsourced to a dedicated hosting service provider. This will allow us to ensure scalability, security and quality of service of our product. Support will slowly be added for additional browsers and platforms. In addition to Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome witch the application already supports, we will also be compatible with major mobile browsers such as Apple's Safari and Samsungs Internet.


##### 2. DATA GATHERING (2 weeks)
Although not a prerequisit to deployment, additional data on asset prices will be gathered throughout this process. Although there are countless assets available to traders, when considering their popularity the majority of these are in the 'long tail' of the distribution. Only traders in commodities and stocks prefer a large number of assets to be represented, prices for these can be gathered once we have deployed the product and are free to approach exchanges for their data.


##### 3. PAYMENT SUPPORT INTEGRATION (1 week)
After registering as a business and opening a business account we will begin working on support for payments. Our target is to deploy our platform with support implemented for Paypal, Visa, Union Pay and Mastercard payments as these are used for the majority of online commerce [2]. There are a number of integrated payment solutions providers on the market that could offer support for all of these and more.


##### 5. SECURITY AUDIT (1 week)
There are two reasons why a security audit is a neccessery step before deployment. Firstly, as we are handling clients payments through the platform, we must ensure that their payment and account information is kept safely. Secondly, as we accrew more data on historic prices, some of that data may no longer come from public sources. Therefore we will hire an external contractor to perform a full security audit. The allocated timeframe should suffice, as our codebase is relatively small, and the majority of data we will be handling at the start is non sensative.


##### 4. TESTING (2 weeks)
Before deployment extensive testing will be conducted to detect any bugs in our software and asses weather or not further changes need to be made. To do this we will assemble a focus group of investors to trial our product. If deemed necessery we will also hire software testers.


### LONG TERM FUTURE AND EXPANSION STRATEGY
Due to the accessible pricepoint of our tool we expect a large increase in the number of users on our platform in the months following deployment. We also expect the structure of our user base to change over time. It is reasonable to expect an increase in the proportions of both users new to trading, and advanced users relative to the size of our user base. Both are less likely to be early adoptors as these groups tend to prefer software that is either more established or already more familiar to them respectively. The ease of use of our softwareâ€™s interface compared with the low price point should already make us an appealing choice for the former of these two groups. We have identified several features that could be implemented going forwards to better cater to these groups:

  - A markup language in which users could define strategies or specify constraints. This would allow them to better simulate their portfolio as part of a their specific trading strategy.
  - Algorithms to highlight market movements and common market patterns. This would be especially appealing to investors that rely heavily on technical analysis of markets and stocks.
  - Significant events that affected the historic prices could be flagged to users, allowing them to form a deeper understanding of the results of their simulations.

As part of our future plan for monetization, our team will also begin development on a version of our product aimed at integration with other retail trading platforms. This we would sell on a subscription basis allowing us to break into a much larger market. The brokerage market in the US alone is valued at around 380 billion dollars[1]. we can simultaneously enter the market by applying the opposite strategy. Tracking of live prices of assets, options to buy and sell commodities (through integration of other platforms or selling them ourselves) and other tools commonly employed by our target audience can be added to our platform. This would allow us to create our own ecosystem for investors and providing us with a good jumping board to enter the brokerage market direcly.
