## Introduction

Navigating through the world of Finance is a daunting task for the average retail investor. While the proliferation of the internet has lowered entry barriers to successful investing as a whole, it has also brought with it an onslaught of misinformation. Confused and scared of the dangers of making wrong decisions, many turn to professionals for managing their money. The reality is, however, that even certified financial advisors underperform a simple indexing strategy in most cases [citation needed]. Designations can often be acquired within hours of training even if one has no prior experience with markets [citation needed]. Add to this an innocent Annual Management Charge of 1% [citation needed] and it is easy to see why most investors underperform the market over longer time horizons[citation needed].

## Problem

To make informed investing decisions, an investor requires data. While past performance certainly isn’t indicative of future results, it is very valuable to look at the historical performance of a given asset allocation.
Imagine you’re nearing retirement and can’t afford sitting patiently through another financial crisis, waiting for your investments to regain in value what they have lost. Wouldn’t it be useful to check a variety of portfolios for how much they’ve lost in the worst year over the last 50?
This process is known as backtesting and is usually done with the assistance of a computer. Existing backtesting software typically falls into one of two categories: Too restricted in features to be useful or too expensive to be affordable.

## Solution

MVG is affordable and feature rich backtesting software that allows investors to assess the viability of investment strategies. With MVG, you can:
• Specify an asset allocation using hundreds of assets across five major asset classes
• Plot the performance of strategies against each other and an index benchmark
• Gain insight into a strategy’s key risk and performance metrics
• Save and share a portfolio to discuss it with friends and your financial advisor
• Model regular contributions and rebalancing strategies

### Specification of Asset Allocation

Our platform allows you to pick assets from five asset classes: Equities, Fixed Income, Currencies, Commodities and Cryptocurrencies. You will be able to design a portfolio using any number of these assets and assign weights to each one (e.g. 25% Apple, 25% Bitcoin, 25% Japanese Yen, 25% Gold).

### Performance Plots

Once you have specified your asset allocation, you can quickly visualize its performance over any time period, up to the first recordings of price data for your assets. To check whether you are exposing yourself to unnecessary risk, you can pick a variety of common indexing strategies as your performance benchmark. These ‘lazy portfolios’ cover, amongst others, the S&P 500, a typical 60/40 split of equities and bonds or the ‘All Weather Portfolio’.

### Strategy Insight

Depending on your investment objectives, you may care about different risk and performance metrics. This is why we’re providing you with a wide variety of them. You’ll be able to see figures for inflation adjusted annual return, maximum drawdown, worst/best year and many more.

### Share your portfolio

Once you’ve discovered an allocation you like, you might want to consult with a person you trust in financial matters, such as your financial advisor. With MVG, it is easy to save a portfolio for revisiting. We also support exporting a strategy to PDF which you can then print out.

### Regular contributions and rebalancing

Saving is a continuous process. To see how regular contributions of fixed amounts to your initial lump sum affect your portfolio’s performance, you can specify a saving interval and amount. Additionally, to prevent your target allocation from becoming unbalanced due to varying performance, you may also specify a rebalancing strategy, such as quarterly or yearly rebalancing.
