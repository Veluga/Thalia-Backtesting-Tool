# Initial Business Case

## Context Analysis

### Market analysis

First and foremost, let us better understand the market we are about to enter. This is of key importance as 42% of startups fail due to the fact that there is no market need for their service.<sup>[1]</sup> Retail investment is a relatively new, but growing market. In the year 2017 in the U.S. alone 54% of households owned stocks or had some other investment plans.<sup>[2][3]</sup> Our target audience consists of these individual investors, who instead of seeking the full package that comes with financial advising, would like to take the wheel, and assess the viability of their investment strategies themselves. In general retail investors are non-professionals and would like to invest smaller amounts. Considering that the typical price of a financial advice service is \$1,500 to \$2,500 for the one-time creation of a full financial plan, the door is closed to many potential individual investors.

### Trend analysis

Let us first consider the macro environmental factors that can influence the investment sector, using PEST analysis. 

#### Political

Political factors such as regulations and government policies can affect the investment sector. In general, people are more willing to invest in politically stable environments, as political disruptions cause hindrances for most businesses. Consequently, investment strategies become less reliable and riskier. 

#### Economic

Economic factors are closely intertwined with the stock market. Not only do low levels of income mean that households have no capability to invest, but economic recessions impact large businesses as well, causing declining revenues and indirectly reducing stock prices.

#### Social

Cultural factors can also influence investment behaviours, as some people may prefer investing into opening their own business over financial investments. For example, a financial study showed that less than half of affluent millennials feel confident about investing and retirement planning.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### Technological

Technological advancements offer more and more elaborate means to analyse data, and thus more accurate evaluations of a given investment strategy. In general, new technological trends motivate investment, as well as boosts the occurrence of new businesses. 

### Competitor analysis

Our competitors are of two types. Financial advisors, who offer backtesting as part of their service, and competing financial software. We have already established that we do not aim to compete with the service provided by financial advisors, as they satisfy another demand altogether. Our main competitors are thus other pieces of software that offer backtesting features.
Some of these are broker and various third-party trading software, such as Fidelity, MetaTrader and NinjaTrader. They are also typically heavily priced due to their nature as a trading software. Other companies, such as ETFreplay, do not offer trading as a service, and solely focus on backtesting. There is a wide range of these as well, considering their quality and pricing.
Most companies of both groups decided to commercialise their products based on a monthly/yearly subscription model, but some of them also offer lifetime licenses. For trading software this ranges between \$100 and \$300 per month, which can be significantly lowered by a lifetime/yearly subscription. However, for a small retail investor who would not use this software on a daily basis, investing hundreds of dollars into a financial software would not be worth it.
On the other hand, for a simple backtesting software this range is \$0 - \$200, and the quality varies with it as well. Some investors are even willing test their portfolios manually, i.e. with the help of excel or using a programming language such as Python, R or MATLAB. The use of these methods shows that there is indeed demand for a high-quality, affordable backtester.
It is also noteworthy to mention that most backtesting and trading software is US based, and thus have either only a limited number of international asset classes and indices or have none at all.

### External factors

In order to conduct further research, let us now discuss some external factors. Following SWOT analysis, these are grouped as the following:

|              | Helpful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Harmful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Internal** | **Strengths**<br/>- A clearly defined set of features and services are a given; we can focus on those rather than spreading ourselves thin.<br/>- Able to offer data from European businesses.<br/>- Better tools available. (*what?*)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Weaknesses**<br/>- Some members of the team lack domain knowledge.<br/>- Cannot compete with the high quality of top-level broker software and their datasets.                                                                                                                     |
| **External** | **Opportunities**<br/>- There is a gap between the excessive number of features offered by broker software (at a higher price) and the basic features free backtesters have to offer.<br/>- The quality and reliability of existing free backtesting software is low, making expectations easier to meet and exceed.<br/>- Most backtesting software is relatively old and unmaintained. A fresh product would thus be easily distinguished on the market. | **Threats**<br/>- The number of infamous examples has made some retail investors sceptical; their trust is harder to earn.<br/>- Unforseed economic and cultural factors can significantly decrease willingness to invest, making the market smaller and therefore more competetive. |

## Financial Analysis

### Commercialising our product

Our strategy is to use a subscription-based business model in order to generate a steady flow of revenue. Based on our previous market analysis we will commercialise our product for a subscription cost of £9.99 (\$12.77) per month, or alternatively £99.99 (\$127.78) per annum. This would make {{MVG}} one of the most accessible backtesters on the market. A trial period of 30 days would also be offered upon registering, with somewhat limited features, but still providing all core functionalities.
The trial period is of key importance: retail investors may be reluctant to spend money on a backtesting product when there are others that seemingly do the same thing. By allowing them to use our software freely for a brief time, we let them see why {{MVG}} is better-suited to their needs. In the event that the customer *doesn't* like our product, the worst thing they can do is write an angry review warning others against it. They are less likely to do so if they don't feel that they lost anything trying it out.
Some of our competitors also use trial periods. Risk-averse retail investors would be more willing to try their product than ours.

### Financial plan

In order to obtain initial funding, we have two options, we can seek investment from venture capitalists (VC) or apply for a bank loan. Since obtaining a loan of this size for a start-up is quite difficult, we will focus on the first of these options. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research a VC can expect a return on investment between 15% and 35%, but 25% in most cases,<sup>[4]</sup> significantly increasing our costs.
As our revenues come from subscriptions, one of our most important figures would be the customer retention rate. Aiming at a 25% retention rate for monthly periods - which is an average rate for media and finance industries<sup>[5][6]</sup> - would provide us with a steady stream of subscribers. Considering this figure as a benchmark this project will be profitable after 12 – 18 months.
