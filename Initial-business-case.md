## Context Analysis
### Market analysis

First and foremost, let us better understand the market we are about to enter, this is of key importance as 42% of startups fail due to the fact that there is no market need for their service. [https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html] Retail investment is a relatively new, but growing market. In the year 2017 in the U.S. alone 54% of households owned stocks or had some other investment plans. [Survey of Consumer Finances - Federal Reserve September 2017 Vol. 103, No. 3] 
Our target audience consists of these individual investors, who instead of seeking the full package that comes with financial advising, would like to take the wheel, and assess the viability of their investment strategies themselves. In general retail investors are non-professionals and would like to invest smaller amounts. Considering that the typical price of a financial advising service costs $1,500 to $2,500 for the one-time creation of a full financial plan, this closes doors for many individual investors. 

### Trend analysis

Let us first consider the macro environmental factors that can influence the investment sector, using PEST analysis. 

#### Political

Some political factors such as regulations as government policies do affect the investment sector. In general, people are more willing to invest in politically stable environments, as political disruptions cause hindrances for most businesses. Consequently, making investment strategies less reliable and riskier. 

#### Economical

Economic factors are closely intertwined with the stock market. Not only do low levels of income mean that households have no capability to invest, but economic recessions impact large businesses as well, causing declining revenues, and indirectly declining stock prices. 

#### Social

Cultural factors can also influence investment behaviours, as some people may prefer investing into opening their own business, to financial investments. For example, a financial study showed that less than half of affluent millennials feel confident about investing and retirement planning.

#### Technological

Technological advancements offer more and more elaborate means to analyse data, and thus more accurate evaluations of a given investment strategy. In general, new technological trends motivate investment, as well as boosts the occurrence of new businesses. 

### Competitor analysis

Our competitors are of two types. Financial advisors, who offer backtesting as part of their service, and competing financial pieces of software. We have already established that we do not aim to compete with the service provided by financial advisors, as they satisfy another demand altogether. Our main competitors are thus other pieces of software that offer backtesting features. 
Some of these are in fact broker and various third-party trading software, such as Fidelity, MetaTrader and NinjaTrader. They are also typically heavily priced due to their nature as a trading software. Other companies, such as ETFreplay, do not offer trading as a service, and solely focus on backtesting. There is a wide range of these as well, considering their quality and pricing. 
Most companies of both groups decided to commercialise their products based on a monthly/yearly subscription model, but some of them also offer lifetime licenses. For a trading software this ranges between $100 and $300 per month, which can be significantly lowered by a lifetime/yearly subscription. However, for a small retail investor who would not use this software on a daily basis, investing hundreds of dollars into a financial software would not be worth it. 

On the other hand, for a simple backtesting software this range is $0 - $200, and the quality varies with it as well. Some investors are even willing test their portfolios manually, i.e. with the help of excel or using a programming language such as Python, R or MATLAB. The use of these methods shows that there is indeed a demand for a high-quality and affordable backtester. 
It is also noteworthy to mention that most backtesting and trading software are US based, and thus have either only a limited number of international asset classes and indices or have none at all.

### External factors

In order to conduct further research, let us now discuss some external factors. Following SWOT analysis, these are grouped as the following:  

#### Opportunities

- There is a gap between excessive number of features offered by broker software (but for a higher price), and the basic features that free backtesters have to offer.
- The quality of existing backtesting software, and their reliability is low, making expectations easier to exceed. 
- Most backtesting software are relatively old, as they are not maintained. A fresh product would thus be easily distinguished on the market. 

#### Threats

- The number of infamous examples has made some retail investors sceptical, and thus their trust is harder to earn. 
- Unforeseen economic and cultural factors can significantly decrease willingness to invest, making the market therefore smaller and more competitive. 

### Organization Analysis

#### Strengths:

- A clearly defined set of features and services are given, which we are able to focus on instead of diversifying too much. 
- Able to offer data from European businesses. 
- Better tools available.

#### Weaknesses:

- Lack of domain knowledge.
- Cannot compete with the high quality of top-level broker software and their datasets.

## Financial Analysis

### Commercialising our product

Our strategy is to use a subscription-based business model in order to generate a steady flow of revenue. Based on our previous market analysis we will commercialise our product for a subscription cost of ?9.99 per month, or alternatively ?99.99 per annum. This would make MVG one of the most accessible backtesters on the market. A trial period of 30 days would also be offered upon registering, with somewhat limited features, but still providing all core functionalities. 
In fact, a trial period is of key importance. Our competitor analysis has also revealed the significance of the product being easily accessible. Clearly a financial investor would base their decision on relevant feedback, but due to the number of competitors available, detaining the user by installation, long registry processes or overcomplicated layout would possibly lead them turning to other alternatives. Although competitors also tend to offer trial periods, it is based on this principle that we could attract a relevant portion of the customer base. 

### Financial plan 

In order to obtain initial funding, we have two options, we can seek investment from venture capitalists (VC) or apply for a bank loan. Since obtaining a loan of this size for a start-up is quite difficult, we will focus on the first of these options. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research a VC can expect a return on investment between 15% and 35%, but 25% in most cases. [National Bureau of Economic Research: How High are VC Returns?] Which significantly increases our costs. 
As our revenues come from subscriptions, one of our most important figures would be the customer retention rate. Aiming at a 25% retention rate for monthly periods, which is an average rate for media and finance industries [https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-retention or https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/2017-Human-Capital-Benchmarking.pdf], would provide us with a steady stream of subscribers. Considering this figure as a benchmark this project will be profitable after 12 – 18 months.
