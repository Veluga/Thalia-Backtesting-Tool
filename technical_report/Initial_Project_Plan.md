# Initial Project Plan

## Team Organisation

Our workflow is centred around the GitHub platform and the tools it provides such as a ticketing system, pull requests and a scrum board for ongoing tasks. Code is reviewed by other team members before any changes are pushed to the production system. We are committed to the Egalitarian Team structure, and as such, there are no fixed responsibilities in our team, and everybody will at some point be required to develop a feature for each part of the system. This save us from introducing any sort of artificial hierarchy into our development process. Consequently, every team member is guaranteed to have a holistic understanding of how the system works across all layers.

To measure productivity, we use effort-oriented metrics, and assign story points to each ticket, based on the time needed and the functionality of the task. This is done by the team member that the ticket was assigned to, and is later reviewed by another member, optimally by the end of the following day. Story points are based on numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, which forces us to consider the value of each ticket carefully and motivates splitting it into two separate tasks if necessary.

## Budget

As we are developing this product as part of a university module, we do not have any budget restrictions other than
time. All of us are committed to allocating a minimum of 10 hours per week to development efforts and are willing to go
beyond that if needed. In order to ensure that we are up to schedule, weekly meetings will be held, which allow the adjustment of workload.

## Milestones

Altough agile methods offer a great amount of flexibility, they do require some sort of governance [[https://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/dad-milestones/](https://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/dad-milestones/)]. For this reason we introduced some important milestones, which will help us to stay on track. We have identified three milestones in the development process, with the last one being much more open ended than the first two, due to the nature of our product. These are the following:

### Minimum Viable Product

This version enables an investor to create a portfolio from a core set of assets and plot its performance versus a predetermined indexing strategy. Since this is not a prototype but a functional product, all future development will expand on this codebase by adding additional features.

### MVG Release 1.0

As defined in our whitepaper, we strive to support five key use cases upon release of our public release of
{MVG}. Hence, this requires the following features to be fully functional:

-   Creating a portfolio from a large set of assets drawn from the major asset classes using input forms.
-   Weighing assets relative to each other by assigning a percentage to them using a range input.
-   Plotting of a portfolio's performance over a time series upon user request.
-   Selection of one of multiple indexing strategies and lazy portfolios from a drop-down list.
-   Display of key metrics in a table.
-   Specification of regular contributions and selection of a rebalancing interval through input forms.

We consider reaching this milestone as sufficient for the scope of this course.

### Development of Additional Features

If time permits and development goes as planned, we have an array of additional features that we would like to see included in our product. As an example, and also the first of these features, we would like to add exportability to portfolios, allowing users to share their strategies, via a link or a downloadable PDF. For an overview, please have a look at appendix X.

## Schedule

Longterm planning is just as important in Agile development as in alternative planning procedures .[[https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/roadmaps](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/roadmaps)] As this term we had a chance to set up the working environment and measure the velocity of development, we can make a prediction of the schedule. During the second semester, we will have a total of 12 weeks for developing the product. As we are following the Agile approach, we have divided the schedule according to milestones.

Each one of these periods will include the development of some or multiple features, as well as testing and deployment. Thus, at each milestone, we aim to have a fully functional product. The scope for each is defined as follows:

-   Week 4 - Closed Beta:
    
    -   Key metrics
        
    -   Integration of historical datasets
        
    -   Additional benchmarks
        
-   Week 8 - Open Release:
    
    -   Creating user accounts
        
    -   Integration of live data APIs
        
    -   Contribution and Rebalancing
        
-   Week 12 - Launch:
    
    -   Exporting portfolio
        
    -   Additional Features
        

As previously stated, we aim at including a number of additional features in order to better distinguish our product. The following is a product roadmap based on this schedule:
