# Initial Project Plan

## Budget

As we are developing this product as part of a university module, we do not have any budget restrictions other than
time. All of us are committed to allocating a minimum of 10 hours per week to development efforts and are willing to go
beyond that if needed.

## Milestones

We have identified three milestones in the development process, with the last one being much more open ended than the
first two.

### Minimum Viable Product

Along with this technical report, we are releasing a stable and functional MVP of {MVG}. This version enables an investor
to create a portfolio from a core set of assets and plot its performance versus a predetermined indexing strategy. Since
this is not a prototype but a functional product, all future development will expand on this codebase by adding
additional features.

### MVG Release 1.0

As defined in our whitepaper, we strive to support five key use cases upon release of our public release of
{MVG}. Hence, this requires the following features to be fully functional:

* Creating a portfolio from a large set of assets drawn from the major asset classes using input forms
* Weighing assets relative to each other by assigning a percentage to them using a range input
* Plotting of a portfolio's performance over a time series upon user request
* Selection of one of multiple indexing strategies and lazy portfolios from a drop-down list
* Display of key metrics in a table
* Exporting a portfolio to PDF or image and providing a download link for either
* Specification of regular contributions and selection of a rebalancing interval through input forms

We consider reaching this milestone as sufficient for the scope of this course.

### Development of Additional Features

If time permits and development goes as planned, we have an array of additional features that we would like to see
included in our product. For an overview, please have a look at appendix X.

## Schedule

During the second semester, we will have a total of 11 weeks for developing the product. As we are using [some flavour
of Agile], we have divided the available time into week long sprints. Each sprint will include development of some or
multiple features as well as testing and deployment. Thus, at the end of each week, we aim to have a fully functional
product. The scope for each sprint is defined as follows:

### Week 1 - Preparing work environment
### Week 2 - Key metrics
### Week 3 - Additional benchmarks
### Week 4 - Integration of historical datasets
### Week 5 - Creating user accounts
### Week 6 - Integration of live data APIs
### Week 7 - Exporting portfolio
### Week 8 - Contribution and Rebalancing
### Week 9 - Optional Features
### Week 10 - Optional Features
### Week 11 - Optional Features
