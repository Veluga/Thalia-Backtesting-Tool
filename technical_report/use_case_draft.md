**Adriana** - 55 year old gardener and single mom

Adriana is nearing retirement. She has invested a significant amount of her savings with a Financial Advisor who manages her portfolio for her.
While she trusts her advisor, she double checks whether her portfolio is exposing her life savings to a lot of unwanted volatility.
She does this by plotting its performance against an index with {MVG}.
Unfortunately, her portfolio has historically both performed worse than a simple 60/40 split and been more volatile over the same timeframe.
Better informed, she decides to take matters into her own hands instead of relying on her ex-Financial Advisor.
