\section{Requirements}
Earlier in the inception phase of the development, we classified our requirements using the established FURPS+ model \cite{FURPS}.
Let us briefly revisit our main functional and non-functional requirements. The items outlined below focus on some of the key requirements we have so far identified as features necessary for providing a compelling product for paying customers.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|X|X|}
\hline
 \textbf{Portfolio Configuration}  &  \\
 \hline
 Allocate fixed amount/proportions of the portfolio to given assets & Choose how much each asset contributes to the portfolio's total value using either percentages or raw monetary amounts \\
\hline
Find assets quickly by category or name & When adding an asset the user can search a category for assets or search for a specific asset by its name \\
\hline
Share portfolio & Portfolios can be shared between people using a URL \\
\hline
Edit portfolio & Change asset allocation and their distributions in a portfolio \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|X|X|}
\hline
 \textbf{Portfolio analysis}  &  \\
 \hline
 Compare portfolios & Use multiple portfolios in a single analysis to see differences in their performance \\
\hline
Use a selection ofÂ  lazy portfolios & Select an existing common portfolio to compare against, such as common index funds (e.g. Vanguard 500 Index Investor or SPY) \\
\hline
Plot portfolio as a time-series & View portfolio performance as a line graph for a quick overview \\
\hline
Specify a time frame for the analysis & Select start and end dates for portfolio analysis \\
\hline
Choose rebalancing strategy & Optionally choose a strategy for buying and selling assets to meet your strategy e.g. buying and selling stocks each year to ensure the value of portfolio stays at 60\% stocks and 40\% bonds (i.e. maintain the initial allocation) \\
\hline
Change the distribution of assets in a portfolio using a slider & A slider for each asset to quickly increase or decrease its proportion of the total value \\
\hline
Edit portfolio analysis & Change parameters for portfolio's analysis after running it (e.g. date range or rebalancing strategy) \\
\hline

 \textbf{View results}  &  \\
 \hline
 See key numerical figures & Show important numerical metrics for a portfolio's performance such as Initial Balance, Standard Deviation, Worst Year, Sharpe Ratio, and Sortino Ratio \\
\hline
See both real and nominal values & See portfolio's value as both adjusted and not adjusted for inflation \\
\hline
A breakdown of portfolio value at specific points of time & See what the value of the portfolio is at some point in time (e.g. January 3rd 1997) \\
\hline
Export result of analysis & Exports results to PDF for sharing and offline reading \\

In the literature, the FURPS+ model has been criticised to disregard developer consideration  \cite{FURPS_drawbacks}, such as not taking into account portability and maintainability.
