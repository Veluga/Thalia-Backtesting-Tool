\section{Introduction}
\subsection {Project Overview}

This project is to create a portfolio backtesting software, which enables creating custom portfolios and measuring their performance with different backtesting functions. The user can pick from a variety of assets, some of which are Equities, Fixed Income, Currencies, Commodities and Cryptocurrencies. Then a quick visualization is performed for the allocated assets with risk and performance metrics.
\subsection{Motivation/Rationale}
Since retail investing is a growing market, our target audience consists of individual investors, who instead of seeking the full package that comes with financial advising, would like to take over the wheel and assess the viability of their investment strategies themselves. As retail investors are non-professionals and invest comparatively small amounts, with financial advice services being non affordable for those individual clients,we wanted to create a product that would not only be more affordable for small retail investors, but would also include a variety of international assets, which currently most backtesting software doesn't include.

\subsection{Project management strategy}

Team members are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Martti Aukia
    \item Arthur-Louis Heath
	\item Albert Boehm
	\item Marcell Veiner
	\item George Stoian
	\item Daniel Joffe
	\item Weronika Kakavou

\end{itemize}

The team held regular meetings, both with the project guide, Dr Nigel Beacham, and the Dr Ernesto Compatangelo. During the analysis stage meetings took place weekly and were aimed to discuss ideas and requirements. Whereas later, during the implementation stage the team held meeting at least once per week, some of which were aimed to discuss the design for the tool with the inclusion of some coding sessions.
