\section{Introduction}
\subsection {Project Overview}

The aim of this project was to create a portfolio backtesting software, which enables creating custom portfolios and measuring their performance with different backtesting functions. The user can pick from a variety of assets, some of which are Equities, Fixed Income, Currencies, Commodities and Cryptocurrencies. Then a quick visualization is performed for the allocated assets with risk and performance metrics.
\subsection{Motivation/Rationale}
Since retail investing is a growing market, our target audience consists of individual investors, who instead of seeking the full package that comes with financial advising, would like to take over the wheel and assess the viability of their investment strategies themselves. As retail investors are non-professionals and invest comparatively small amounts, with financial advice services being non affordable for those individual clients, our goal was to create a product that would not only be more affordable for small retail investors, but would also include a variety of international assets, which currently most backtesting software fails to provide.

\subsection{Project management strategy}

The creators of Thalia are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Martti Aukia
    \item Arthur-Louis Heath
	\item Albert Boehm
	\item Marcell Veiner
	\item George Stoian
	\item Daniel Joffe
	\item Weronika Kakavou
\end{itemize}

The team held regular meetings, both with the project guide, Dr Nigel Beacham, and the Dr Ernesto Compatangelo. During the analysis stage meetings took place weekly and were aimed to discuss ideas and requirements. Whereas later, during the implementation stage the team held meeting at least once per week, some of which were aimed to discuss the design for the tool with the inclusion of some coding sessions.

As previously we had our workflow centered around the GitHub platform and the tools it provides.
Furthermore, we continued to follow the Egalitarian Team structure, as this worked very well during the first term of the course. As for the effort-oriented metrics, discussed in previous reports, we concluded that they were too artificial in our case.

As we were fortunate enough to gain an additional member this term, some of our initial effort was focused on introducing her to the project and team dynamics. Having such a large team and a new member it was common to have coding tickets assigned for pairs and groups rather than individuals, we believe this did not only result in writing better-quality code, but in faster team communication when making design decisions.

\subsection{Budget}
As previously discussed, we did not have any budget restrictions other than time. All of us agreed to allocating a minimum of 10 hours per week to development efforts, and discussed personal expectations well in advance.
