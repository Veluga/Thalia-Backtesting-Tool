#Api Caller module internals

#### Database comunications
Connects to the database when the module is started and provides methods of communication to the other internal modules.

* Data updating logic writes to the database 

#### Api calls activator
Makes sure that our data harvesting does not get blocked. In addition it also spreads the bandwidth consumption over a period of time. For the mvg we could have just one burst of data collection however.
Depending on the installation some apis should be saved as modules.


#### Api specific options
For the moment I have tested quandl and yfinance. They seem to have more than enough data for our MVG. Both download the data and place it in pandas dataframes. 
 
 * yfinance does not seem to have any limit on the data you can pull. The only problem would be keeping it all updated. At some point some of the downloads fail and that has to be further investigated. (I have found a list of 100 000 tickers)
 * Quandl has a limit of 10 bulk downloads per hour I have produced a list of tickers available, but plenty of data exists. Now finding the free one seems to be a problem. It seems like lots of information has to be known when calling for data. 
 * Nomics is used for the crypto data
 
 All in all thos 3 are deeply integrated into python and have more then enough data for a MVG I would say.


####Data updating logic (DUL)
The data updating logic needs to have a model of what data is available from what Apis and when to update that data. It requires a connection to the database comunication module so that it can read/update the data. However since the data updating logic is the one asking for the data it might be able to construct a model of the available data.
A example of how this would work would be: DUL creates a list of data that has to be pulled trough a API, the data is assigned to a api and that api has a cooldown time(even if not required if you have too many calls in a short time, you get blocked) and key if required.


####Data Integrity
The apis used at the moment noomics and yfinance are doing data integrity checks.Because of this at this current moment the Harvester does not check for data integrity.

####Obersvations
The modules have different ways of calling for data.
